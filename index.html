        <div><p>Messi just singed the contract with Inter Miami and not with Barchelona as expected</p></div>
        <div><img src="messi.jpeg"><p>
            The 35-year-old superstar will officially leave PSG this month when his contract expires after two seasons with the French giants.
                 After spending his entire career with Barcelona, he made the jump to France after his beloved 
                team could no longer afford him under La Liga's financial rules, seeing an end to an iconic 
                era at the club with diminutive Argentina as the face, winning every prize imaginable more than once. 

                Messi revealed that while he had offers from other clubs to stay in Europe, he never really considered them.
                
                "I had offers from other European cubs but I didn't even consider them because my idea was to go to Barcelona and if it didn't work out, analyzing it,
                I'd leave European soccer, especially after winning the World Cup, which was what I was missing to close out my career on this side 
                and experience the league in the United States,
                 another way and enjoy the day-to-day but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and do the right thing, just with more tranquility."  </p>

        <div><p>The Reds have got their man, luring the Argentine from the south coast to Merseyside for his fourth season in the Premier League.

            The 24-year-old arrives after four years and 112 appearances for the Seagulls, during which time he helped Argentina lift the World Cup in 2022.
            
            He is now the 10th different Red to have lifted the World Cup trophy and immediately improves Liverpool’s midfield options, which is the primary focus during the summer window.
            
            Mac Allister arrives after the club triggered a release clause, reported to be as low as £35 million, signing a long-term contract at Anfield that’s understood to be until 2028.
